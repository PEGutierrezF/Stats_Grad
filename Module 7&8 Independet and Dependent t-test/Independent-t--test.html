# t-test

- A **t-test** is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two variables.

- **Student t-test** is named after its inventor, William Gosset, who published under the pseudonym of student.

# When would you run a t-test?

- You have a continuous response variable.

- You want to test for a **difference between two sample means**: considering the variance within each group, do the groups belong to two distinct populations, or not?

- Data is **normally distributed** and both groups have approximately **equal variance**. 

- If the groups are **not related** in any way = **Independent t-test**

- If the groups are **related (paired)** = Dependent t-test (or matched pairs t-test).


---

# Independent vs. Dependent groups

How do I know if my samples are independent or dependent?  

Can you tell exactly which observation should be paired with which other observation?  If you can't tell, your groups are independent

.pull-left[
**Examples of Independent Samples**

1. Treated and untreated, randomly located plots.
2. Monitoring sites set up with Systematic (grid) sampling.
3. Infested and uninfested forest stands selected with stratified random sampling.
]

.pull-right[
**Examples of Dependent Samples**

1. Before and After data taken on the same observation.
2. Paired watersheds / plots.
3. Parent / offspring studies.
4. Twin studies / partner studies.

# Degrees of Freedom (DF)

- The number of observations that are free to vary when calculating a statistic.

- Importance in Inferential Statistics:
  - Similar to the mean and standard deviation in one-sample tests, degrees of freedom is **a critical value** used in calculating test statistics for inferential tests.
  - Unlike the one-sample z-test, many inferential tests (such as the t-test) rely on degrees of freedom to **accurately determine the p-value**.


---
# Degrees of Freedom (DF)

- Example:
  - Imagine a classroom with 30 seats. The first 29 people who enter can choose any seat. However, the 30th person has no choice—they can only sit in the one empty seat left.

  - In a similar way, when you calculate the average (mean) of a group of 30 numbers, the first 29 numbers can vary freely. The 30th number is fixed because it has to be whatever value is needed to reach the average you calculated.

  - So, when estimating the mean from a sample of 30 numbers, the degrees of freedom is 29.

---
# Degrees of Freedom (DF)

.pull-left[ 
- Depending on the type of the analysis you run, degrees of freedom typically (but not always) relate the size of the sample. Because **higher degrees of freedom** generally mean **larger sample sizes**, a higher degree of freedom means more power to reject a false null hypothesis and find a significant result.

**Independent t-test** quantifies the difference between sample means (numerator) vs. the amount of variability in the samples (denominator).

**Dependent t-test** quantifies the magnitude of the difference between paired observations (numerator) vs. the amount of variability in the samples (denominator).

$$
t = \frac{\sum D}{\sqrt{\frac{n \sum D^2 - (\sum D)^2}{n-1}}}

DF (for the critical value) = n-1

# The Basic Steps for an Inferential Test in R

- Start with a research question and your data ready.

- Follow these steps:
1. State your hypothesis. 
2. Work in R
    - Import libraries and load necessary packages.
    - Import your data.
    - Run descriptive statistics to understand your data.
    - Visualize the data distribution.
    - est for normality and check other assumptions (e.g., equal variance).
3. Select the appropriate statistical test. 
4. Run the analysis in R and evaluate statistical significance.
5. Calculate Cohen's Effect Size (if relevant).
5. Summarize your findings.

# Example #1

# Two-tailed t-test Example

**Research Question**:  The state is looking to choose a stream for habitat restoration for native trout species.  Streams with deeper pools will provide necessary cover in the winter months and minimize potential scouring from severe rain events.  Which stream should they focus on?  Test to see if there is a significant difference in depth between stream 1 and stream 2?


``` r
stream_data &lt;- read.csv('Lecturer Practice/two_tail_water data.csv')
head(stream_data)
```

```
##   X waterbody depth_cm
## 1 1   stream1     42.6
## 2 2   stream1     48.4
## 3 3   stream1     46.2
## 4 4   stream1     44.2
## 5 5   stream1     44.4
## 6 6   stream1     50.6
```

---

# Load libraries

``` r
library(RVAideMemoire) # for shapiro.text()
library(dplyr) # for filter() and more
library(lsr) # Cohen’s d for two-sample t-test
```


---

# Step 1. Normality test

- Test for normality

.pull-left[ 

``` r
byf.shapiro(depth_cm~waterbody, data=stream_data)
```

```
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality tests
## 
## data:  depth_cm by waterbody 
## 
##              W p-value
*## stream1 0.9698  0.4749
*## stream2 0.9819  0.7822
```
]

.pull-right[ 
- Since both p-values are greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for both streams. 

- This indicates that the data are **normally distributed** for both Stream 1 and Stream 2. 
]


---

# Step 2. Equal variance

.pull-left[

``` r
#var.test
var.test(depth_cm ~ waterbody, data=stream_data)
```

```
## 
## 	F test to compare two variances
## 
## data:  depth_cm by waterbody
*## F = 0.99478, num df = 32, denom df = 37, p-value = 0.9945
## alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.5080442 1.9810856
## sample estimates:
## ratio of variances 
##          0.9947842
```
]

.pull-right[

- Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

- Therefore, we conclude that the **variances** of pool depth between the two streams are **equal**.

# Conducting the t-test

Based on the results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, which indicated that both Stream 1 and Stream 2 data are normally distributed, and the F-test for equal variance, which showed that the variances are equal, we proceeded to conduct a two-tailed independent t-test.

# Conducting the t-test


``` r
t.test(filter(stream_data, waterbody == "stream1")$depth_cm, 
       filter(stream_data, waterbody == "stream2")$depth_cm,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 0, 
       paired = FALSE, 
       var.equal = TRUE)
```

```
## 
## 	Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  filter(stream_data, waterbody == "stream1")$depth_cm and filter(stream_data, waterbody == "stream2")$depth_cm
*## t = -12.924, df = 69, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:

# Summary

&lt;span style="color:#00796B;"&gt;We tested to see if there was a significant difference in pool depth between Stream 1 and Stream 2, which are being considered for habitat restoration for native trout species.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#E65100;"&gt;Using a two-tailed independent t-test to compare depth measurements from 71 total samples,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#1E88E5;"&gt;we found a significant and meaningful difference between the streams ( `\(t_{(69)} = -12.92, \, p &lt; 2.2 \times 10^{-16}, ES=3.08)\)`.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="color:#424242;"&gt;This indicates that Stream 2, with deeper pools, may provide more suitable habitat for trout, offering better cover during winter and reducing the risk of scouring during severe rain events.&lt;/span&gt;
