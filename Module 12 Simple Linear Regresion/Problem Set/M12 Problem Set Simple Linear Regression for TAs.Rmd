We conducted an experiment to investigate the potential relationship between temperature variations and plant growth. We measured the height of specific plant species across a range of temperatures.  

Perform a simple linear regression to explore this relationship. Use the variables: **loght and temp**.  
1. What is the response variable?  
2. What is the explanatory variable?  
3. Since regressions can help model scenarios, determine the regression equation for the (log) plant height as a function of temperature.  
4. Summarize:  Write a concise one paragraph summary of this analysis. Remember that any summary should include the following:   
a. Statement of the research hypothesis or study objectives.  
b. Brief summary of methods (one sentence or less).  
c. Statement of the statistical results (including type of test and shorthand: R-squared= obtained value, p = 0.xxx).  
d. Description of any differences, if meaningful, along with an interpretation of why these results make sense (or don't make sense).  


#1. Import libraries and load packages
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```


#2. importing our data
```{r}
Plant_height <- read.csv(file = "Plant_height.csv", header = TRUE)
head(Plant_height)
```


#3. Run a Simple Linear Regresion
```{r}
model <- lm(loght ~ temp, data = Plant_height)
summary(model)
```
