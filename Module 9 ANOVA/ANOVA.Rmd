# What is ANOVA
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique, commonly used to studying differences between two or more group means. 

- ANOVA test is centered on the different sources of variation in a typical variable.

- This statistical method is an extension of the t-test. 

- It is used in a situation where the factor variable has more than one group.

# Hypothesis in one-way ANOVA test
.pull-left[
- $H_0$: All group means are equal.

  - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots = \mu_k$
]

.pull-right[ 
- $H_a$: At least, the mean of one group is different

  - $H_A: \mu_i \neq \mu_j \quad \text{for some } i, j$

# When would you run an ANOVA?

- I have a continuous response variable.

- I want to know the difference in that response between more than two groups.

- I have one factor I am testing (One-Way ANOVA).

# Assumptions

- All groups are Independent.

- The data is normally distributed.

- All groups have approximately equal variance.
  - A good rule of thumb: ratio of largest to smallest group stdev must be less than 2:1
  - The ANOVA is less sensitive to this requirement when samples are of equal size from each population.

---
# Assumptions

- A common misconception is that the **response variable** must be normally distributed when conducting an ANOVA. This is **incorrect** because the normality assumptions pertain to the **residuals**, not the response variable.

- The key assumption of ANOVA is that the **residuals** **are independent** and come from a **normal distribution** with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$. Specifically:
<center>
$y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$
</center>
Where:
- $y_{ij}$ This is the observed value of the response variable for the $j$-th observation in the $i$-th group
- $\mu$ is the overall mean
- $\alpha_i$ is the effect of the $i$-th group
- $\epsilon_{ij} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)$, where $\epsilon_{ij}$ represents the residual error.

- Thus, it is the **residuals** $\epsilon_{ij}$ that must be normally distributed, not the response variable $y_{ij}$.

---
# How ANOVA works 
- The ANOVA obtained value (the **F-statistic**) is a ratio of the Between Group Variation divided by the Within Group Variation:      

<center>
F = $\frac{\text{Between group variance}}{\text{Within group variance}}$
</center>

- A large **F** is evidence against $H_0$, since it indicates that there is more difference between groups than within groups.


---
# Finding the critical value for an F-test

.pull-left[ 
- You will need the critical F table that matches your significance level.

- And you will need to know the degrees of freedom for both the between and within variability.

# Effect Size Measures
- Significant **F ratios** indicate that there is a difference between the treatment groups that cannot be explained by chance alone.
  
- Effect size measures help determine how big or meaningful the effect of the treatment is.


---
# Effect Size Measures
- One simple effect size measure:
<center>
$r^2 = \frac{\text{SSB}}{\text{SST}}$

Where:
  - **SSB** is the sum of squares between groups (variability due to group differences),
  - **SST** is the total sum of squares (total variability in the dataset).

- This measure shows how much of the total variability in the data can be explained by the different groupings.   
- **What is meaningful?**  
It depends on how much of the total variability you would expect this grouping to account for.

# Check Assumptions

# Check Assumptions 
- Check normality assumption by analyzing the model residuals. QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk test of normality are used. QQ plot draws the correlation between a given data and the normal distribution.

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
plot(one.way, 2) 
```
]

.pull-right[
]

# Check Assumptions

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
plot(one.way, 2)

.pull-right[
- Compute Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
```{r highlight.output = 5}
shapiro.test(residuals(one.way))
```
]

---
# Check Assumptions 
- In the QQ plot, as all the points fall approximately along the reference line, **we can assume normality**.

- This conclusion is supported by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The p-value is not significant (p = 0.7594), so we can **assume normality**.


---
# Check Assumptions
- The residuals versus fits plot can be used to check the homogeneity of variances.

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
plot(one.way, 1) 
```
]

.pull-right[
In the plot above, there is no evident relationships between residuals and fitted values (the mean of each groups), which is good. So, we can assume the **homogeneity of variances**.

# Post-hoc test

---
# Post-hoc test

- In order to see which group(s) is(are) different from the others, we need to compare groups 2 by 2. 

- In practice, since there are 3 species, we are going to compare species 2 by 2 as follows:

  - One vs Two
  - One vs. Three
  - Three vs. Two
