# What is ANOVA
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique, commonly used to studying differences between two or more group means. 

- ANOVA test is centered on the different sources of variation in a typical variable.

- This statistical method is an extension of the t-test. 

- It is used in a situation where the factor variable has more than one group.

# Hypothesis in one-way ANOVA test
.pull-left[
- $H_0$: All group means are equal.

  - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots = \mu_k$
]

.pull-right[ 
- $H_a$: At least, the mean of one group is different

  - $H_A: \mu_i \neq \mu_j \quad \text{for some } i, j$
]

# When would you run an ANOVA?

- I have a continuous response variable.

- I want to know the difference in that response between more than two groups.

- I have one factor I am testing (One-Way ANOVA).

---
# Assumptions

- All groups are Independent.

- The data is normally distributed.

- All groups have approximately equal variance.
  - A good rule of thumb: ratio of largest to smallest group stdev must be less than 2:1
  - The ANOVA is less sensitive to this requirement when samples are of equal size from each population.

---
# How ANOVA works 
- The ANOVA obtained value (the **F-statistic**) is a ratio of the Between Group Variation divided by the Within Group Variation:      

<center>
F = $\frac{\text{Variation}_{\text{between}}}{\text{Variation}_{\text{within}}}$
</center>

- A large **F** is evidence against $H_0$, since it indicates that there is more difference between groups than within groups.

# Effect Size Measures
- Significant **F ratios** indicate that there is a difference between the treatment groups that cannot be explained by chance alone.
  
- Effect size measures help determine how big or meaningful the effect of the treatment is.


---
# Effect Size Measures
- One simple effect size measure:
<center>
$r^2 = \frac{\text{SSB}}{\text{SST}}$

Where:
  - **SSB** is the sum of squares between groups (variability due to group differences),
  - **SST** is the total sum of squares (total variability in the dataset).

- This measure shows how much of the total variability in the data can be explained by the different groupings.   
- **What is meaningful?**  
It depends on how much of the total variability you would expect this grouping to account for.
