# What is ANOVA
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique, commonly used to studying differences between two or more group means. 

- ANOVA test is centered on the different sources of variation in a typical variable.

- This statistical method is an extension of the t-test. 

- It is used in a situation where the factor variable has more than one group.

# Hypothesis in one-way ANOVA test
.pull-left[
- `\(H_0\)`: All group means are equal.

  - `\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots = \mu_k\)`
]

.pull-right[ 
- `\(H_a\)`: At least, the mean of one group is different

  - `\(H_A: \mu_i \neq \mu_j \quad \text{for some } i, j\)`
]

# When would you run an ANOVA?

- I have a continuous response variable.

- I want to know the difference in that response between more than two groups.

- I have one factor I am testing (One-Way ANOVA).

# Assumptions

- All groups are Independent.

- The data is normally distributed.

- All groups have approximately equal variance.
  - A good rule of thumb: ratio of largest to smallest group stdev must be less than 2:1
  - The ANOVA is less sensitive to this requirement when samples are of equal size from each population.

---
# Assumptions

- A common misconception is that the **response variable** must be normally distributed when conducting an ANOVA. This is **incorrect** because the normality assumptions pertain to the **residuals**, not the response variable.

- The key assumption of ANOVA is that the **residuals** **are independent** and come from a **normal distribution** with mean 0 and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`. Specifically:
&lt;center&gt;
`\(y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}\)`
&lt;/center&gt;
Where:
- `\(y_{ij}\)` This is the observed value of the response variable for the `\(j\)`-th observation in the `\(i\)`-th group
- `\(\mu\)` is the overall mean
- `\(\alpha_i\)` is the effect of the `\(i\)`-th group
- `\(\epsilon_{ij} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)\)`, where `\(\epsilon_{ij}\)` represents the residual error.

- Thus, it is the **residuals** `\(\epsilon_{ij}\)` that must be normally distributed, not the response variable `\(y_{ij}\)`.

---
# How ANOVA works 
- The ANOVA obtained value (the **F-statistic**) is a ratio of the Between Group Variation divided by the Within Group Variation:      

&lt;center&gt;
F = `\(\frac{\text{Between group variance}}{\text{Within group variance}}\)`
&lt;/center&gt;

- A large **F** is evidence against `\(H_0\)`, since it indicates that there is more difference between groups than within groups.


---
# Finding the critical value for an F-test

.pull-left[ 
- You will need the critical F table that matches your significance level.

- And you will need to know the degrees of freedom for both the between and within variability.

# Effect Size Measures
- Significant **F ratios** indicate that there is a difference between the treatment groups that cannot be explained by chance alone.
  
- Effect size measures help determine how big or meaningful the effect of the treatment is.


---
# Effect Size Measures
- One simple effect size measure:
&lt;center&gt;
`\(r^2 = \frac{\text{SSB}}{\text{SST}}\)`

Where:
  - **SSB** is the sum of squares between groups (variability due to group differences),
  - **SST** is the total sum of squares (total variability in the dataset).

- This measure shows how much of the total variability in the data can be explained by the different groupings.   
- **What is meaningful?**  
It depends on how much of the total variability you would expect this grouping to account for.

# Check Assumptions 
- Check normality assumption by analyzing the model residuals. QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk test of normality are used. QQ plot draws the correlation between a given data and the normal distribution.

---
# Check Assumptions 
- In the QQ plot, as all the points fall approximately along the reference line, **we can assume normality**.

- This conclusion is supported by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The p-value is not significant (p = 0.7594), so we can **assume normality**.


---
# Check Assumptions
- The residuals versus fits plot can be used to check the homogeneity of variances.

.pull-left[

``` r
plot(one.way, 1) 
```

![](ANOVA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[
In the plot above, there is no evident relationships between residuals and fitted values (the mean of each groups), which is good. So, we can assume the **homogeneity of variances**.

# Post-hoc test

# Post-hoc test

- In order to see which group(s) is(are) different from the others, we need to compare groups 2 by 2. 

- In practice, since there are 3 species, we are going to compare species 2 by 2 as follows:

  - One vs Two
  - One vs. Three
  - Three vs. Two
