# When do you do a Factorial ANOVA
- You have a continuous response variable.
- You have two or more categorical treatment variables:  
  - You want to simultaneously test for differences in on the response variable  OR
  - You want to block for a source of known variability to better isolate the effect of the variable of interest    OR
  - You suspect that there are interactions between variables that might hide the true nature of relationships
