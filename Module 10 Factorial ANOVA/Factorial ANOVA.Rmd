# What is a Full Factorial Experiment?
- A factorial experiment allows researchers to study the joint **effect of two or more factors** on a **dependent variable**.

- Factorial designs are an **extension of single factor ANOVA** designs in which additional factors are added such that each level of one factor is applied to all levels of the other factor(s) and these combinations are replicated.

---
# Treatment Groups in Full Factorial Design
- Factor A has two levels (i.e., A1 and A2), factor B has three levels (i.e., B1, B2 and B3). Therefore, the full factorial design has 2 x 3 = 6 treatment groups.

|         | B1            | B2            | B3            |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| A1      | Group 1      | Group 2      | Group 3      |
| A2      | Group 4      | Group 5      | Group 6      |

# When do you do a Factorial ANOVA
- You have a continuous response variable.

- You have two or more categorical treatment variables (factors).

  - You want to simultaneously test for differences in the response variable across these factors.

  - You want to block for a source of known variability to better isolate the effect of the main variables of interest.

  - You suspect there may be interactions between the factors that could influence the response, potentially hiding the true relationships.

# ANOVA Terminology

- **One-Way ANOVA**: Used when you have one treatment variable. The non-parametric alternative is the **Kruskal-Wallis test**.

- **Factorial ANOVA**: Applied when there are two or more treatment variables. The name reflects the number of groups and variables, e.g., a 2x3 Factorial ANOVA. The non-parametric alternative is Friedman’s k-way test.

- **Full Factorial ANOVA**: Used when you are also considering interaction terms between variables. This analysis examines the **main effects** and **interactions** among factors.

# Factorial ANOVA ANOVA test hypotheses

- Two-way ANOVA Test Hypotheses:

  - $H_{0A}: \mu_{A1} = \mu_{A2} = \dots = \mu_{Ak}$ 
(There is no difference in the means of factor A).

  - $H_{0B}: \mu_{B1} = \mu_{B2} = \dots = \mu_{Bk}$ 
(There is no difference in the means of factor B).

  - $H_{0AB}$: There is no interaction between factors A and B.

- Alternative Hypotheses:

  - $H_{1A}$: The means for factor A are not equal.

  - $H_{1B}$: The means for factor B are not equal.

  - $H_{1AB}$: There is an interaction between factors A and B.

# Assumptions of two-way ANOVA test
- Two-way ANOVA, like all ANOVA tests, makes the following assumptions:

- The observations within each cell are normally distributed.
- The variances across groups are equal (homogeneity of variances).

# Example
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/anova-in-r/
```

---
# Example
```{r}
crop <- read.csv('Lecturer Practice/crop.csv')
head(crop)
```

---
# Data visualization
- Visualize the data distribution using boxplots and jitter for individual points:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]
```{r plot1, fig.show='hide', fig.width=5.5, fig.height=5.5}
ggplot(crop) +
  aes(x = fertilizer, y = yield, fill = density) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), alpha = 0.6, outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = density), shape = 15, position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.2, dodge.width = 0.75)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Yield by Fertilizer and Density",
       x = "Fertilizer",
       y = "Yield") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("low" = "lightblue", "high" = "lightcoral")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("low" = "blue", "high" = "red"))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("plot1", ".png")`)
]
]

# Running the Full Factorial ANOVA
- Run Full Factorial ANOVA to assess differences between fertilizer groups:
```{r highlight.output = 2:4}
interaction <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer*density, data = crop)

summary(interaction)
```

---
# Data visualization
- Visualize the data distribution using boxplots and jitter for individual points:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]
```{r plot2, fig.show='hide', fig.width=7, fig.height=5.5}
ggplot(crop, aes(x = fertilizer, y = yield, color = density, group = density)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1), size = 2) + # jitter for clarity
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun = mean, size = 1) + # line for mean yield
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, shape = 18) + # mean points
  labs(title = "Interaction of Fertilizer and Density on Yield",
       x = "Fertilizer Treatment",
       y = "Yield") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("low" = "blue", "high" = "red"), 
                     labels = c("Low Density", "High Density")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.title = element_blank())
```

# Running the Post-hoc Test
```{r, highlight.output = 8:10}
tukey.two.way <- TukeyHSD(interaction)
tukey.two.way
```

# Visualizing the Post-hoc Test

- The plot below visualizes the results of the Tukey HSD test:

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
tukey.plot.test <- TukeyHSD(interaction)

# How to summarize results

<span style="color:#00796B;">In this analysis, we examined the effect of fertilizer type and planting density on crop yield</span> <span style="color:#E65100;"> using a two-way ANOVA.</span> 
<span style="color:#1E88E5;"> Results showed that both fertilizer type and planting density significantly influenced yield, with fertilizer having an $F_{(2, 90)} =9.001, p<0.001 , r^2 =$ and density showing an even stronger effect with $F_{(1,90)} = 15.195, p<0.001 , r^2 =$. However, the interaction between fertilizer and density was not significant $F_{(2,90)} =0.635 , p=0.532 , r^2 =$, indicating that the effect of fertilizer on yield does not depend on planting density. A post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test revealed specific differences between fertilizer treatments: crops receiving the second fertilizer type showed significantly higher yields than the control group $(p<0.001)$, and also had significantly higher yields than the first fertilizer treatment $(p=0.012)$. Additionally, crops grown at lower planting densities had significantly higher yields than those grown at higher densities $(p<0.001)$. </span><span style="color:#424242;"> These results suggest that choosing an effective fertilizer and managing planting density are crucial for optimizing crop yield. However, the lack of a significant interaction indicates that adjustments in planting density do not change the relative effectiveness of the fertilizers tested.
