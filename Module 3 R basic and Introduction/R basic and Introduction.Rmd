# What is R Programming?
- R is a free and open source software environment and programming language for statistics.

- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University
of Auckland (in New Zealand), and is based on the S language that
was created by John Chambers at Bell Laboratories.

# What is R Programming?
- When you download and install R, you get a collection of basic packages (and libraries) that can be used to implement several common data manipulations, graphical displays, and statistical models.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
* **Strengths:**  
-Free and Open Source.  
-Strong User Community.  
-Highly extensible, flexible.  
-Implementation of high-end statistical methods.  
-Flexible graphics and intelligent defaults.  

--

* **Weakness:**  
-Steep learning curve.  
-Slow for large datasets. 

---
# Why R?
- **Computing power**: R can handle much larger datasets than traditional programs, which is especially important for long-term ecological data, community science data, and public health data.

--

- **Flexibility & convenience**: Traditionally, scientists would need separate programs for data cleaning, statistical procedures, and data visualization.  
Learning R means you can do everything in a single program, and
customize to fit the goals of your project.

--

- **Reproducibility**: Saving your code as an R script makes it easy for other scientists to see what you did, and repeat your methods.

---
# R Overview

---
# How to download?
- Google it using R or CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)  
  - http://www.r-project.org

---
# How to download?
- Having installed R, the next thing we will want to do is install **RStudio**, a popular and useful interface for writing scripts and using R.

- If you google **RStudio** you will get to this window:  
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

- Rstudio is an ***integrated development environment (IDE)*** for R that allows users to interact more easily with R by integrating different aspects of scripting, from code completion to debugging.

# Data structures

---
# Data structures
- R is an object oriented programming language where an **object** is a generic term to describe something in R.

--

- There are many types of R-objects.  
  1. Vectors  
  2. Factors  
  3. Lists  
  4. Matrices  
  5. Data Frames  

---
# Vectors in R
- Vector is a sequence of elements of the same type (numeric, character, logical).
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
b <- c(6,7,8,9,10)
```
- Command *c* creates a vector that is assigned to object a and b

---
# Vectors in R
- Two vectors of the same lenght can be addedd (a+a), multiply (a*a)
```{r}
c <- (a+b)
c

d <- (a*b)
d
```

---
# Vectors in R
- Element in a vector can be sorter (*sort()*)
```{r}
e <- c(3,2,20,25,5)
sort(e)
```

---
# Factors in R
- Categorical data structure with predefined levels.
```{r}
f <- factor(c("low", 'medium', "high", 'very high'))
```

---
# Data
- R has three general classes for data:  

  1. **list**: collection of objects of different lengths or classes 
  2. **matrix**: vectors of the same length and same class
  3. **data.frame**: vectors of the same length and different classes

---
# Lists 
- A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, functions and even another list inside it.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Creating a list in R with various types of elements
my_list <- list(
  # A numeric vector
  Numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  # A character vector
  Words = c("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
```

--

```{r}
my_list
```



---
# Matrices 
- A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. 
- It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Create a 3x3 matrix in R
my_matrix <- matrix(
  data = 1:9,       # Data to fill the matrix
  nrow = 3,         # Number of rows
  ncol = 3,         # Number of columns
  byrow = TRUE)      # Fill the matrix by rows
my_matrix
```


---
# Data Frames 
- Data frames are tabular data objects. 
- **Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data.** 

--

- The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column - Can be logical. 

--

- It is a list of vectors of equal length. 

--

- Data Frames are created using the `data.frame()` function.

# Summary

---
# Reading data

---
# Reading data
- **CSV File**
 - Usage: Reads comma-separated values, often used for structured data.
```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("file.csv")
```

--
- **Text File**  
 - Usage: Reads tabular data from a text file; sep can be adjusted for different delimiters.
```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- read.table("file.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

```

--
- **Excel File**
 - Usage: Reads data from Excel files; you can specify the sheet number or name.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

---
# Reading data
- Print the current working directory
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

--

- Change to my directory
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd(mydirectory)
setwd("c:/docs/mydir") 
```

---
# Reading data
- Subscripts are given inside square brackets after the object's name:
- df[,1]
  - Gets the **first column** from the object dat

- df[1,]
  - Gets the **first row** from the object dat

- df[1,1]
  - Gets the **first row** and it's **first column** from the object dat

---
# Assigning Values in R
- In R, you can assign values to objects using the syntax object <- value
- An arrow (<-) formed by a smaller than character and a hyphen without a space!
- The equal character (=).

---
# R Warning!
- Naming objects:
    - R is a case sensitive language. 
    - FOO, Foo, and foo are three different objects 
    - Object names can't start with a number
    - Never use special characters, such as Ã¥, Ã¤, or Ã¶ in object names.

---
# Using Functions in R
- R is a function based language where a ***function*** takes in some input and produces some output.
  - Vegas rules: what happens in a function, stays in a function.

---
# Data Visualization in R
- Most powerful approach to statistical graphs, based on the **Grammar of Graphics**.

- A graphics language, composed of layers, **geoms** (points, lines, regions), each with graphical **aesthetics** (color, size, shape)
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

                                   y = <y axis variable>)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = <size variable>, 
                   color = <color variable>, 
                   shape = <shape variable>))
