# Expanding on Hypothesis Testing

- **Tails in hypothesis testing** represent the critical regions where **extreme values** of the test statistic indicate significant differences. If the test statistic falls in one of the tails, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.


$$
H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad 
H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0 \quad \text{or} \quad 
H_1: \mu &lt; \mu_0 \quad \text{or} \quad 
H_1: \mu &gt; \mu_0
$$

   - where:
    - `\(μ\)` = True population mean (unknown, what we're testing)
    - `\(μ_0\)` = Hypothesized population mean (the reference value in `\(H_0\)`)

--

- To test this hypothesis, we define both rejection and acceptance regions. These regions are determined by our chosen significance level, typically set at **0.05**.

# Types of Hypothesis Tests

- If your obtained test statistic falls beyond the critical value (in the light blue region) for your given significance level ( `\(\alpha\)` ), the result is significant, and you **reject the null hypothesis**.

## Expanding on Hypothesis Testing 
- 2-tailed tests: 
    - Have **no expected directionality hypothesized**.
    - Split the 5% significance level (α = 0.05) between both tails of the normal distribution curve (i.e., 2.5% in each tail).
    - Are therefore more conservative and less powerful than one-tailed tests, meaning they require stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

# Critical Value: Definition and Origin

- A **critical value** is the threshold beyond which **we reject the null hypothesis** ( `\(H_0\)` ) in a statistical test. It is determined by the significance level ( `\(\alpha\)` ), which represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis).

- It separates the **rejection region** (where you reject the null hypothesis) from the **non-rejection region** on the distribution curve of the test statistic. 

- The critical value indicates how many standard deviations away from the mean we must go to enter the rejection region. For example, a critical value of `\(\pm\)` 1.645 means we are 1.645 standard deviations away from the mean in a one-tailed test.

---
# Critical Values for Common Significance Levels:
- One-tailed test ( `\(\alpha\)`= 0.05): Critical value = `\(\pm\)` 1.645.
- Two-tailed test ( `\(\alpha\)`= 0.05): `\(\alpha\)` is split into 2.5% in each tail, leading to the widely used = `\(\pm\)` 1.96.

# Understanding Critical Values and Probabilities in Z-tests

| Question Type | Given | Function | Example | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Find probability (area below z-score) (left, smaller, less than) | z-score | `pnorm(z)` | `pnorm(0.76)` → 0.776 | Proportion of area to the left of z = 0.76 |
| Find probability (area above z-score) (right, beyond, larger than) | z-score | `1 - pnorm(z)` | `1 - pnorm(0.76)` → 0.224 | Proportion of area to the right of z = 0.76 |
| Find z-score for left cumulative area (e.g., bottom 5%) | Probability | `qnorm(p)` | `qnorm(0.025)` → -1.96 | Z-score corresponding to the lower 2.5% of the distribution |
| Find z-score for right cumulative area (e.g., top 5%) | Probability | `qnorm(1 - p)` | `qnorm(0.975)` → 1.96 | Z-score corresponding to the upper 2.5% of the distribution |

# Significant or Not?

.pull-left[
- **Not Significant**:  
  - Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  - There is **no** sufficient evidence to suggest a difference between the sample and population mean.
  - Obtained test statistic **&lt;** critical value threshold.
  - p-value **&gt;** alpha threshold (usually 0.05).

# Basic steps for an **Inferential Test**

- We can select an appropriate test simply by answering some questions.

1. What type of data do we have?
    - If we have frequency data, we select a test from the Chi-square family.
    - If we have continuous and categorical variables, the appropriate test depends on the research question:
  
2. What type of research question are we considering?
    - If we are comparing one sample mean to a population mean, we use a **z-test**.
    - If the focus is on differences between groups or treatments, we select a test from the **t-test or ANOVA** family.
    - If we are interested in relationships between variables, we use **correlation tests**.
    - If the goal is to predict outcomes, we use the **regression family**.

- Every statistical test has a letter designating the type of test.
- Because power is so closely tied to sample size, we report sample size.
- For clarity (and to confirm the correct-tailed test is used to assess the p-value), include the calculated test statistic value.
- Always report the p-value.
- Some tests will also include a secondary metric to assess how meaningful results are (if significant).

# One sample z-test

---
# When would you run a one-sample z-test?
- Use the One Sample z-test when:
  1. You want to test for a **difference** between one **sample mean** and a larger **population mean**.
  2. There is only **one group (sample)** being tested against the larger **population**.
  3. You know (or can estimate) the mean and standard deviation of the population.
      - Expert Information.
      - Scientific Literature.
      - Data archives.
      - Meaningful (hypothesized value).
  4. Data is normally distributed.


---
# One sample z-test formula
- The formula for the one-sample z-test is:

`$$z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`

- where:  
    - `\(\bar{X}\)`: Sample mean.  
    - `\(\mu\)`: Population mean.  
    - `\(\sigma\)`: Population standard deviation.
    - `\(n\)`: Sample size.

# One sample z-test

- Assume you have a sample of **20 observations**. The mean of this **sample is 150**, and you want to determine whether there is a **difference between the sample mean and the larger population mean**. Since you are not specifying a direction for this difference, you will conduct a two-tailed test.

- The **population mean is 164**, and the **population standard deviation is 33**.

- Next, calculate the obtained value for this **one-sample z-test.**

.pull-left[$$z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

.pull-right[
`$$z = \frac{150 - 164}{\frac{33}{\sqrt{20}}} = -1.897$$`

# Critical value approach

- In the critical value approach, we compare the calculated **test statistic** to the **critical value** from the standard normal distribution. 

- For a **two-tailed test** at the `\(\alpha\)` = 0.05 significance level, the critical values are approximately ±1.96, which corresponds to the **0.025** in each tail.

--

- Decision Rule:
    - If |calculated test statistic| &gt; critical value → **Statistically Significant.**
    - If |calculated test statistic| ≤ critical value → **Not Statistically Significant.**

---
# Critical Value Approach

- In this case:

`$$|-1.897| &lt; 1.96$$`

- Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is **no significant** difference between the sample mean and the population mean.

---
# Finding the p-value

- Now we need to determine the probability (p-value) associated with the calculated test statistic. You have several options to achieve this:


``` r
z_value &lt;- -1.897
p_value &lt;- 2 * pnorm(z_value)  # Two-tailed p-value
p_value  # This will give the result
```

```
*## [1] 0.05782794
```

--

- Since this p-value (0.0578) is greater than the alpha threshold of 0.05, we conclude that the result is **not significant**.

- The test statistic for the one-sample **z-test is 4.0415** and the corresponding **p-value** is `\(p = 2.66 \times 10^{-5}\)` .

# Example: Another example

.teal[We tested a water sample to determine whether the mean lead level exceeds the regulatory limit of 15 ppb.] .orange[Using a random sample of three lead measurements in a one-tailed, one-sample z-test,] &lt;span style="color:#005EB8;"&gt;we found that the mean lead level is significantly greater than the regulatory limit ( `\(z_{(3)} = 4.04, \ p = 2.66 \times 10^{-5}\)` ).&lt;/span&gt; .darkgray[This result indicates that it is highly unlikely that the true mean lead level is 15 ppb or lower. We suggest further investigation and corrective actions to reduce the lead concentration, as the sample mean was 15.58 ppb.]
