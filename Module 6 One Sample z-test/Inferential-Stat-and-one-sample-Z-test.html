# Expanding on Hypothesis Testing

- **Tails in hypothesis testing** represent the critical regions where **extreme values** of the test statistic indicate significant differences. If the test statistic falls in one of the tails, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.


$$
H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad 
H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0 \quad \text{or} \quad 
H_1: \mu &lt; \mu_0 \quad \text{or} \quad 
H_1: \mu &gt; \mu_0
$$

   - where:
    - `\(μ\)` = True population mean (unknown, what we're testing)
    - `\(μ_0\)` = Hypothesized population mean (the reference value in `\(H_0\)`)

--

- To test this hypothesis, we define both rejection and acceptance regions. These regions are determined by our chosen significance level, typically set at **0.05**.

- If your obtained test statistic falls beyond the critical value (in the light blue region) for your given significance level ( `\(\alpha\)` ), the result is significant, and you **reject the null hypothesis**.

## Expanding on Hypothesis Testing 
- 2-tailed tests: 
    - Have **no expected directionality hypothesized**.
    - Split the 5% significance level (α = 0.05) between both tails of the normal distribution curve (i.e., 2.5% in each tail).
    - Are therefore more conservative and less powerful than one-tailed tests, meaning they require stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

# Significant or Not?

.pull-left[
- **Not Significant**:  
  - Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
      - We fail to reject because in statistics, we cannot prove anything with 100% certainty; we just don’t have enough evidence to reject it.
  - There is **no** sufficient evidence to suggest a difference between the sample and population mean.
  - Obtained test statistic **&lt;** critical value threshold.
  - p-value **&gt;** alpha threshold (usually 0.05).

# Basic steps for an **Inferential Test**
.pull-left[
- A statement of null hypothesis:
    - Know the research Hypothesis.

    - Including if a 1 or 2-tailed test.
- Set the level of Type I error risk ( `\(\alpha\)` ):
    - Usually &lt; 0.05.
- Analyze data distribution:
    - Do you meet assumptions like normality and independence?
- Compute the test statistic (obtained) value:
    - Calculated from formula.

- Assess significance:
    - Determine the critical value needed to  reject the null hypothesis and compare it to your:

      - P-value &lt; alpha threshold = significant

# Basic steps for an **Inferential Test**

1. What type of data do we have?
  
2. What type of research question are we considering?

# Basic steps for an **Inferential Test**

- We can select an appropriate test simply by answering some questions.

1. What type of data do we have?
    - If we have frequency data, we select a test from the Chi-square family.
    - If we have continuous and categorical variables, the appropriate test depends on the research question:
  
2. What type of research question are we considering?
    - If we are comparing one sample mean to a population mean, we use a **z-test**.
    - If the focus is on differences between groups or treatments, we select a test from the **t-test or ANOVA** family.
    - If we are interested in relationships between variables, we use **correlation tests**.
    - If the goal is to predict outcomes, we use the **regression family**.

- Every statistical test has a letter designating the type of test.
- Because power is so closely tied to sample size, we report sample size.
- For clarity (and to confirm the correct-tailed test is used to assess the p-value), include the calculated test statistic value.
- Always report the p-value.
- Some tests will also include a secondary metric to assess how meaningful results are (if significant).

# One sample z-test

---
# When would you run a one-sample z-test?
- Use the One Sample z-test when:
  1. You want to test for a **difference** between one **sample mean** and a larger **population mean**.
  2. There is only **one group (sample)** being tested against the larger **population**.
  3. You know (or can estimate) the mean and standard deviation of the population.
      - Expert Information.
      - Scientific Literature.
      - Data archives.
      - Meaningful (hypothesized value).
  4. Data is normally distributed.


---
# One sample z-test formula
- The formula for the one-sample z-test is:

`$$z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`

- where:  
    - `\(\bar{X}\)`: Sample mean.  
    - `\(\mu\)`: Population mean.  
    - `\(\sigma\)`: Population standard deviation.
    - `\(n\)`: Sample size.

# One sample z-test

- Assume you have a sample of **20 observations**. The mean of this **sample is 150**, and you want to determine whether there is a **difference between the sample mean and the larger population mean**. Since you are not specifying a direction for this difference, you will conduct a two-tailed test.

- The **population mean is 164**, and the **population standard deviation is 33**.

--

- Next, calculate the obtained value for this **one-sample z-test.**

.pull-left[$$z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
]

.pull-right[
`$$z = \frac{150 - 164}{\frac{33}{\sqrt{20}}} = -1.897$$`
]

# Critical value approach

- In the critical value approach, we compare the calculated **test statistic** to the **critical value** from the standard normal distribution. 

- For a **two-tailed test** at the `\(\alpha\)` = 0.05 significance level, the critical values are approximately ±1.96, which corresponds to the **0.025** in each tail.

--

- Decision Rule:
    - If |calculated test statistic| &gt; critical value → **Statistically Significant.**
    - If |calculated test statistic| ≤ critical value → **Not Statistically Significant.**

---
# Critical Value Approach

- In this case:

`$$|-1.897| &lt; 1.96$$`

- Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is **no significant** difference between the sample mean and the population mean.

---
# Finding the p-value

- Now we need to determine the probability (p-value) associated with the calculated test statistic. You have several options to achieve this:


``` r
z_value &lt;- -1.897
p_value &lt;- 2 * pnorm(z_value)  # Two-tailed p-value
p_value  # This will give the result
```

```
*## [1] 0.05782794
```

--

- Since this p-value (0.0578) is greater than the alpha threshold of 0.05, we conclude that the result is **not significant**.

- A rental car company claims the mean time to rent a car on their **website is 60 seconds with a standard deviation of 30 seconds**.

# Example: Another example

A water quality regulation specifies that the lead level in drinking water should be no more than **15 ppb** ( `\(\mu\)` ) with a standard deviation ( `\(\sigma\)` = 0.25. A random sample of three lead measurements yielded values of 15.84, 15.33, and 15.58. Perform a one-sided z-test to determine if the mean lead level exceeds 15 ppb.

       mu = ,  # Population mean (to test against)
       sigma.x = )  # Population standard deviation
```

--

- where:
    - x: Sample data values.
    - alternative: Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options:
      - "greater": Tests if the sample mean is significantly greater than mu.
      - "less": Tests if the sample mean is significantly smaller than mu.
      - "two.sided": Tests for any significant difference from mu.
    - mu: The hypothesized population mean.

# Example: Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test

- To perform a one-sample Wilcoxon test, R provides a function wilcox.test() that can be used as follow:

``` r
wilcox.test(x, 
            alternative = "greater",  # Specify alternative hypothesis: "greater", "less", or "two.sided"
            mu = 0)  # the theoretical mean/median value. Default is 0 but you can change it.
```

- where:
    - x: Sample data values.
    - alternative: Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options:
      - "greater": Tests if the sample median is significantly greater than mu.
      - "less": Tests if the sample median is significantly smaller than mu.
      - "two.sided": Tests for any significant difference from mu.
    - mu: The hypothesized population median.
