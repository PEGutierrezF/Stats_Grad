## Normality, Probability and Significance
- Why did we focus on normality?
  - The **normal distribution** is a key tool for determining the probability of a given value occurring in a population that follows this distribution.

<br>

- It allows us to make inferences about a population by calculating how likely it is for data to fall within certain ranges.

<br>

- Many statistical tests assume data follows a **normal distribution**, which helps in determining **significance** and making reliable conclusions.


## Hypothesis Testing 
- All inferential tests use a formula that calculates a **test statistic**, quantifying the relationship or difference you are testing.
- The variance \( \sigma^2 \) is calculated as:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("$$t = \\frac{\\bar{X_1} - \\bar{X_2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$")

```
