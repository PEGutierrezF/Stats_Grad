# What is Correlation?
- A correlation test quantifies how two variables change together.
  - Are the variables closely related?
  - To what extent does one variable predict the other?

---
# When to Use Correlation?
- Correlation test is used to **evaluate** the **association between two or more variables**.

- You have two continuous variables measured from the same observational unit.

- You want to determine if the variables are related (vary in unison).

---
# Key Assumptions:
- Independent, random samples.

- Normality:
  - Pearson correlation (parametric): Assumes both variables follow a normal distribution.
  - Spearman correlation (nonparametric): Does not assume normality.

- Linear relationship: Correlation looks for a linear association between the variables.

---
# Describing Correlations
- **Strength**: Indicates how closely the variables are related.
    - Categories: Weak, Moderate, Strong
    
- **Nature**: Shows the direction of the relationship.
    - Direct (Positive): As one variable increases, so does the other.
    - Indirect (Negative): As one variable increases, the other decreases.

- **Significance**: Assesses if the correlation is meaningful.
    - Based on the p-value, which tells us if the observed relationship is likely due to chance.

---
# Hypothesis testing with Correlations
- Null Hypothesis ( $H_0$ )
- ** $H_0$ **: There is no correlation in the population.
  - For a two-tailed test, this means there is **no linear relationship** between x and y.
   $$ H_0: r = 0 $$
   $$ p > 0.05 $$

- Alternative Hypothesis ( $H_1$ )
- ** $H_1$ **: There is a real, non-zero correlation in the population.
  - The alternative hypothesis suggests a **significant linear relationship** between x and y.
   $$ H_1: r \neq 0 $$
   $$ p < 0.05 $$

---
# Computing Simple Correlations
- There are many kinds of correlation coefficients but the most commonly used measure of correlation is the **Pearson’s correlation (parametric statistic)**. 

$$r_{XY} = \frac{n \sum XY - \left( \sum X \right) \left( \sum Y \right)}{\sqrt{\left[ n \sum X^2 - \left( \sum X \right)^2 \right] \left[ n \sum Y^2 - \left( \sum Y \right)^2 \right]}}$$

Where:

- $r$ = Pearson Correlation Coefficient
- $N$ = Number of pairs of observations
- $∑XY$ = Sum of the products of paired values
- $∑X$ = Sum of the \(x\) scores
- $∑Y$ = Sum of the \(y\) scores
- $∑X^2$ = Sum of the squared \(x\) scores
- $∑Y^2$ = Sum of the squared \(y\) scores

# Coefficient of Determination ( $r^2$ )
- $r^2$ quantifies the proportion of variability in one variable that can be explained by its relationship with the other variable.

- It represents the shared variability between the two variables, indicating how much of the total variability they have in common.

- When two variables are correlated, $r^2$ tells us how much variance in one variable can be accounted for by the other.

- This concept is similar to the Effect Size we examined in ANOVA.

---
# Difference between $r$ and $r^2$
- $r$ (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient):
  - Measures how much two variables vary together.
    - Ranges from -1 to 1:
      - -1: Perfect negative correlation
      - 0: No correlation
      - 1: Perfect positive correlation
    - Unitless and applicable across contexts.

      - 0: No correlation
      - 1: Perfect positive correlation
    - Unitless and applicable across contexts.

- $r^2$ (Coefficient of Determination):
  - Indicates the proportion of variability explained by the relationship.
    - Ranges from 0 to 1:
      - 0: No variability explained
      - 1: All variability explained
    - Interpreted as the percentage of variance explained.

---
# p-value of the correlation 
The p-value (significance level) of the correlation can be determined :

  - by using the correlation coefficient table for the degrees of freedom : **df= n−2**, where **n is the number of observation in x and y variables**.


---
# p-value of the correlation 
The p-value (significance level) of the correlation can be determined :

  - by using the correlation coefficient table for the degrees of freedom : **df= n−2**, where **n is the number of observation in x and y variables**.

  - or by calculating the t value as follow:
$$
t = \frac{r_1 - r_2}{\sqrt{\frac{1 - r^2}{n - 2}}}
$$

In the case 2) the corresponding p-value is determined using t distribution table for df=n−2

---
# Understanding significant correlations
- **Significant correlations** indicate that fluctuations in the values are sufficiently regular, making it unlikely that the association occurred by chance.

- However, significance does not imply meaningfulness:
  - A significant correlation does not guarantee that the amount of variance accounted for is practically significant.

- Use ** $r^2$ to assess the meaningfulness** of your results:
  - Interpret $r^2$ to understand the proportion of variance explained by the correlation and its practical implications.

# Complications and limitations of correlation
- **Spurious Correlations**:
  - A significant correlation may not indicate a direct relationship between the two variables.
  - It can arise from an indirect correlation influenced by a third variable.
  - For example, an observed correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents might be spurious, driven by a third factor like temperature.

- **Causation vs. Correlation**:
  - Correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other.

- **Context Matters**:
  - Always consider the context and underlying mechanisms that could affect the relationship between the variables.

---
# Multivariate interpretation
- What to Do?

---
# Multivariate interpretation
- What to Do?
- Check out your Partial Correlations.

  - Purpose: These correlations adjust each correlation to account for the influence of all other variables in the analysis.
  - Benefit: They reveal the unique relationship between variables by removing the influence of others.
  - When to use: Conduct this analysis only on variables that significantly correlate with your variable of interest.

---
# Partial Correlations
- Keep in Mind:
  - These new partial correlations have been adjusted for covariance with all other variables.
  - The goal is to isolate the unique covariance between the two variables of interest.

- Important Note:

  - Expect these values to be lower than the original correlations!
    - Why? Because we are accounting for the influence of other variables.
  - Focus on relative strength rather than trying to meet an absolute threshold of strength.

---
# Other complications
- Quantifying Relationships: Pearson’s, Spearman’s non-parametric, and Partial Correlations are all designed to quantify linear relationships.

  - They will not detect nonlinear relationships.

- Misleading Data: Correlations using rates and averages (smoothed data) can be misleading.

---
# Things to remember
- Correlations only tell us about the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.
- We cannot interpret causality from correlation alone.

---
# Spearman correlation formula
The Spearman correlation method computes the correlation between the rank of $x$ and the rank of $y$ variables:

$$\rho = \frac{\sum (x' - \bar{X}) (y' - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x' - \bar{X})^2 \sum (y' - \bar{Y})^2}}$$

Where $x' = rank(x)$ and $y' = rank(y)$.
