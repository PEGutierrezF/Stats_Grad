# Dependent t-test

- Used when we have dependent samples - matched, paired or tied somehow:
  - Repeated measures
  - Brother & sister, husband & wife
  - Left hand, right hand, etc.

- Useful to **control individual differences**.  Can result in more powerful test than independent samples t-test.

---
# Assumptions

1. The dependent variable must be continuous.  

2. The two groups are paired.  

3. No significant outliers in the difference between the two related groups.

4. The **difference** between the two related treatment groups should be **normally distributed**.

# Function

.pull-left[ 
```{r, eval=F}
t.test(x= , y = ,
       `mu = 0`, 
       paired = , 
       var.equal =, 
       alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater")
       )
```
]


.pull-right[ 

- The **mu** argument indicate the true value of difference in means for a two sample test.

- Hypotheses testing for mean difference $\mu_d$:

  - $H_0: \mu_d = 0$

  - $H_1: \mu_d \neq 0$ (two-tailed)
  - $H_1: \mu_d > 0$ (upper-tailed)
  - $H_1: \mu_d < 0$ (lower-tailed)

# Example 

- Background About the Experiment:

- During the winters of 2015 and 2016, scientists simulated ice storms in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire by spraying water onto the forest canopy, creating ice accretion that mimicked natural storm conditions. Some plots received ¼ inch, ½ inch, or ¾ inch of ice, while treatments were repeated in 2017 to study the effects of consecutive storms.

Task:

- Your task is to determine if live basal area (m²/ha) is significantly greater in control plots compared to ice-treated plots, using data collected one year after the initial treatment.

# Import your data

# Run descriptive statistics

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#  Test for normality 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, highlight.output =5}
shapiro.test(ice_before_after$Control)
shapiro.test(ice_before_after$Ice)

# Test for equal variance (homogeneity in variances)

#8. Run the code for the appropriate test

```{r tx-wrangle, highlight.output = 5}
t.test(ice_before_after$Control, ice_before_after$Ice,
alternative = "greater",
mu = 0, 
paired = TRUE, 
var.equal = TRUE,

# Simple plot of differences

- A simple plot of differences between one sample and the other.  Points below the blue line indicate observations where Ice is greater than Control, that is where (Control - Ice) is negative. 

.panelset[

```{r two, fig.show='hide', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
Difference = ice_before_after$Control - ice_before_after$Ice

plot(Difference,
     pch = 16,
     ylab="Difference (Control - Ice)")
