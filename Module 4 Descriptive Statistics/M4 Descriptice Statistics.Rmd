## Why describe data?
- Determine if our sample reflects the population of interest.  

<br>

- Identify outliers.  

<br>

- Obtain metrics necessary for inferential tests.  

<br>

- Understand the distribution of our data values – test for normality.  

<br>

- Identify the type of statistical test to run.  


## Data description and visualization
- We can examine our data and run statistical tests to see if the distribution approximates a normal curve.  
- Typically, we start by visualizing our data.    


```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.2}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set parameters for the normal distribution
mean <- 0
sd <- 1
n <- 1000

# Generate data
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n, mean, sd))

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
    color = "red",
    size = 1
  ) +
  xlab("Value") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Histogram basic
- Continuous data are most commonly visualized using Histograms. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/Histogram.jpg")
```

## Box and Whisker Basics
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/box.jpg")
```

## Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:

  - Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles)
  - Skew
  - Kurtosis (Peakedness)

## Central tendency
- Mean (Sum of scores/N)
  - Most often used measure of central tendency.
  - Works well with normal and relatively normal curves.

- Median (50th Percentile)
  - No formula.  Rank order observations then find the middle.
  - The second most used measure of central tendency.
  - Works best with highly skewed populations.
  
- Mode (Most Frequent Score)
  - Least used measure of central tendency.
  - Works best for highly irregular and multimodal distributions. 


## Central tendency: Mean

- Sample mean is the measure of central tendency that best represents the population mean.

- Mean is **very** sensitive to extreme scores that can “skew” or distort findings.


## Central tendency: Meadian
- Percentiles are used to define the percent of cases equal to and below a certain point on a distribution.
  - The median **is the 50th percentile ** half of all observations fall at or below this value.
- But lots of other percentiles are also important.

## A little about Percentiles
- Quartiles are a common percentile used to represent the value below  which. 
  - 25% (Q1 or first quartile)  
  - 75% (Q3 or third quartile)  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quartiles.jpg")
```
                     
## When to use What
- Use the **Mode** when the data are categorical:  
  - **Mode**: is the value that occurs most frequently in your data.  
  - This is because having the same value occur for measurements with many significant digits is highly unlikely.

<br>

- Use the **Median** when you have extreme scores:  
  - **Median**: is simply the value that falls in the middle of all your data. 

<br>

- Use the **Mean** the rest of the time. 

  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/CnetralTendency.jpg")
```


## Variability
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/variability.png")
```

## Variability: Standard Deviation
- Standard Deviation measures how spread out the numbers in a dataset are around the mean.

<br>

- The sample standard deviation \( s \) is calculated as:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$")
``` 


## Variability
- **Variance** measures the average of the squared differences from the mean, indicating how spread out the data points are.

<br>

- The variance \( \sigma^2 \) is calculated as:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$")
```


## Variability: Range
- **Range** is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset, providing a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data.

<br>

- The range is calculated as:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("$$\\text{Range} = \\text{max}(x) - \\text{min}(x)$$")
```

## Percentiles are useful for spread too
- You can use percentiles to get a feel for how spread out the data is and where most of your observations are contained:

  - Inter-quartile range (IQR) = Q3 – Q1  

## Identifying outliers
- An outlier is an observation that lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution (Moore and McCabe 1999). 

<br>

- Usually, the presence of an outlier indicates some sort of problem. (e.g. an error in measurement or sample selection).

<br>

- But they may also be an indicator of novel data or identification of unique and exciting observations.

## Identifying outliers
- The first and third quantiles (Q1 and Q3) are often calculated to identify outliers. 

<br>

- One method for systematically identifying outliers uses:
  - Q1 - (1.5 * the inter-quartile range)
  - Q3 + (1.5 * the inter-quartile range)

<br>

- Others identify outliers as any values below the 0.5th or above the 99.5th percentile. 

## When to use What
- Use the **Standard deviation (SD)** in most cases.
  - SD quantifies how far, on average, each observation is from the mean. 
  - The larger the SD, the more highly variable your data.

<br>

- Use **range (R)** when describing predictive models. 
  - R is simply the maximum minus the minimum value in your data set
  - R is important when modeling or making predictions, since your algorithms are valid only over the range of values used to calibrate your predictive model

<br>

- Use the **IQR** to identify and test potential outliers in your data.

## Skewness
- Skewness: This metric quantifies how balanced (symmetrical) your 
distribution curve is.
