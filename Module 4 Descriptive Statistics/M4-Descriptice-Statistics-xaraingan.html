# Why describe data?
- Determine if our sample reflects the population of interest.  


- Identify outliers.  


- Obtain metrics necessary for inferential tests.  


- Understand the distribution of our data values (i.e., test for normality).  


- Identify the type of statistical test to run.  

---

# Data description and visualization
- We can examine our data and run statistical tests to see if the distribution approximates a normal curve.  
- Typically, we start by visualizing our data.

---
# Histogram basic
- Continuous data are most commonly visualized using Histograms. 

- Histograms display the distribution of data by grouping values into intervals or bins, allowing for an understanding of the frequency and spread of the data.

&lt;img src="fig/Histogram.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Box and Whisker Basics
- Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of continuous data, showing the **median**, **interquartile range (IQR)**, and **potential outliers**.

- The **box** represents the middle 50% of the data (from the first quartile \( Q1 \) to the third quartile \( Q3 \)).

- The **line inside the box** shows the median (50th percentile).

- **Whiskers** extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from \( Q1 \) and \( Q3 \).
- **Data points outside the whiskers** are considered potential **outliers**.

# Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:
  - Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles, range)
  - Skew
  - Kurtosis (Peakedness)

---
# Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:
  - **Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)**
  - Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles)
  - Skew
  - Kurtosis (Peakedness)

---
# Central tendency
- **Mean `\(\frac{\sum X}{n}\)` **:
    - Most often used measure of central tendency.
    - Works well with normal and relatively normal curves.

--

- **Median (50th Percentile)**:
    - No formula.  Rank order observations then find the middle.
    - The second most used measure of central tendency.
    - Works best with highly skewed populations.

--

- **Mode (Most Frequent Score)**:
    - Least used measure of central tendency.
    - Works best for highly irregular and multimodal distributions. 
    
---
# Central tendency: Mean
$$ \bar{X} = \frac{\sum X}{n} $$
- where:
    - ** `\({X}\)` ** represents individual data points and ** `\(n\)` ** is the number of observations.

--

- Sample mean is the measure of central tendency that best represents the population mean.

--

- Mean is **very** sensitive to extreme scores that can "skew" or distort findings.

---
# Central tendency: Median
- Percentiles are used to define the percent of cases equal to and below a certain point on a distribution.
  - The median **is the 50th percentile**, meaning *half of all observations fall at or below this value*.
  
- But lots of other percentiles are also important.

---
# A little about Percentiles

.pull-left[
- Quartiles (i.e., divide data into four equal parts: 25%, 50%, 75%) are a common percentile used to represent the value below  which. 
  - 25% (Q1 or first quartile)  
  - 75% (Q3 or third quartile)

---
# When to use What
.pull-left[

- Use the **Mode** when the data are categorical:
  - **Mode**: is the value that occurs most frequently in your data.  
  - This is because having the same value occur for measurements with many significant digits is highly unlikely.


- Use the **Median** when you have extreme scores:  
  - **Median**: is simply the value that falls in the middle of all your data. 

- Use the **Mean** the rest of the time.

# Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:
  - Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - **Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles)**
  - Skew
  - Kurtosis (Peakedness)
  
---
# Variability
.center[
&lt;img src="fig/variability.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]

---
# Variability: Standard Deviation
- **Standard Deviation** measures how spread out the numbers in a dataset are around the mean.

--

- The sample standard deviation `\(s\)` is calculated as:
`$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$`

  - `\(s\)` : The **sample standard deviation**, which measures the spread or variability of the data points around the sample mean `\(\bar{x}\)`.
  - `\(n\)`: The **sample size**, or the number of observations in the dataset.
  - `\(x_i\)`: Each individual data point in the sample.
  - `\(\bar{x}\)`: The **sample mean**, or the average of the sample data.

---
# Variability: Variance
- **Variance** measures the average of the squared differences from the mean, indicating how spread out the data points are.

- The variance `\(\sigma^2\)` is calculated as:
`$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$`

- **Variance is always larger than the Standard Deviation (SD)** because variance is the square of SD. 
  - For example, if the SD is 3, the variance will be `\(3^2 = 9\)`.


---
# Variability: Range
- **Range** is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset, providing a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data.

--

- The range is calculated as:
`$$\text{Range} = \text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)$$`

---
# Percentiles are useful for spread too
- You can use percentiles to get a feel for how spread out the data is and where most of your observations are contained:

  - Inter-quartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1  

.center[  
&lt;img src="fig/iqr.png" width="45%" /&gt;
]

---
# Identifying outliers
- An **outlier** is an observation that lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution (Moore and McCabe 1999). 

--

- Usually, the presence of an outlier indicates some sort of problem. (e.g. an error in measurement or sample selection).

--

- But they may also be an indicator of novel data or identification of unique and exciting observations.

---
# Identifying outliers
- The first and third quantiles (Q1 and Q3) are often calculated to identify outliers. 

--

- One method for systematically identifying outliers uses:
  - Q1 - (1.5 * the inter-quartile range)
  - Q3 + (1.5 * the inter-quartile range)


---
# When to use What
- Use the **Standard deviation (SD)** in most cases.
    - SD quantifies how far, on average, each observation is from the mean. 
    - The larger the SD, the more highly variable your data.

--

- Use **range (R)** when describing predictive models. 
    - R is simply the maximum minus the minimum value in your data set.
    - R is important when modeling or making predictions, since your algorithms are valid only over the range of values used to calibrate your predictive model.

--

- Use the **IQR** to identify and test potential outliers in your data.

---
# Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:
  - Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles)
  - **Skew**
  - Kurtosis (Peakedness)

---
# Skewness
- **Skewness**: This metric quantifies how balanced (symmetrical) your 
distribution curve is.

.center[  
&lt;img src="fig/skewness.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]

---
# Skewness
- A **normal distribution** will have its mean and median values located somewhere near the center of its range.

.center[  
&lt;img src="fig/skewness.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]

---
# Skewness
- Skew of this peak away from center is common when extreme values pull the median away from the mean.

.center[
&lt;img src="fig/skewness.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]
---
# Skewness
- **Positive Skew**: the "slide" takes you in a positive direction.
  - The mean is bigger than the median (which is why the slide is being pulled to higher values).
  
- **Negative Skew**: the "slide" takes you in a negative direction.
  - The mean is smaller than the median (which is why the slide is being pulled to lower values).

.center[  
&lt;img src="fig/skewness.png" width="60%" /&gt;
]

---
# Calculating Skew
- Negative value = Negative Skew.
- Positive value = Positive Skew.
- Zero = Normal distribution.

`$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{3(\bar{X} - \text{Median})}{\text{SD}}$$`

- where:
  - `\(\bar{X}\)` is the **sample mean**, representing the average of all data points.
  - **Median** is the middle value in a dataset when sorted in ascending or descending order.
  - **SD** (Standard Deviation) measures the spread of the data points around the mean.

---
# Skewness: Significant?
- To determine if this deviation from zero in the skew statistic is likely a significant departure from normality, compare it to the **standard error of skew (ses)**.

- If the skew you have calculated is more than **2 times the ses**, then you likely have significant skew, which means you have **non normal data** and should consider a nonparametric test for your statistical analyses


$$
\begin{array}{cc}
ses = \sqrt{\frac{6}{n}} &amp; \hspace{1cm} \text{Skewness} = \frac{3(\bar{X} - \text{Median})}{\text{SD}}
\end{array}
$$

---
# Metrics to Describe data distribution.
- Data and their associated distributions can be described in four primary way:
  - Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Variability (standard deviation, variance, quantiles)
  - Skew
  - **Kurtosis (Peakedness)**
  
---
# Kurtosis
- **Kurtosis** is simply a measure of how pointy or flat the peak of your distribution curve is.

- Any deviation from a bell shape, with the peak either too flat (platykurtic) or too peaked (leptokurtic), suggests that your data are not normally distributed.

.center[
&lt;img src="fig/kurtosis.png" width="50%" /&gt;
]

---
# Kurtosis
- Positive values = Leptokurtic.
- Zero  = Mesokurtic = normal (bell-shaped). 
- Negative values = Platykurtic.


$$
\text{Kurtosis} = \frac{\sum(\left( \frac{x_i - \bar{X}}{\text{SD}} \right)^4 - 3)}{n}
$$

- where:
  - `\(x_i\)` represents each individual data point.
  - `\(\bar{X}\)` is the **sample mean**, the average of all data points.
  - **SD** (Standard Deviation) is the measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean.
  - `\(n\)` is the number of data points in the sample.
  - The subtraction of 3 is to adjust for the kurtosis of a normal distribution, which has a kurtosis of 3.

---
# Kurtosis: Significant?
- To determine if this deviation from zero in the kurtosis statistic is likely a significant departure from normality, compare it to the **standard error of kurtosis (sek)**.

- If the kurtosis you have calculated is more than **twice the sek**, you likely have **non normal data** and should consider a nonparametric test for your statistical analyses.


$$
\begin{array}{cc}
sek = \sqrt{\frac{24}{n}} &amp; \hspace{2cm} \text{Kurtosis} = \frac{\sum \left( \frac{x_i - \bar{X}}{\text{SD}} \right)^4 - 3}{n}
\end{array}
$$

# Data Distributions

---
# Data Distributions
- There are various types of data distributions, each with its own unique properties and implications. 

- **In nature, most data are normally distributed**.

- The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.

$$
\bar{X}_n \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$

  - The sample mean `\(\bar{X}_n\)` will follow a normal distribution with mean `\(\mu\)`  and standard deviation of `\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`. 
    - As the sample size `\(n\)` increases, the standard deviation (here: `\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`) decreases, improving the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean `\(\mu\)`.

---
# Why do we care if our data is normal?
- The mathematical foundations of many statistical analyses **assume that data follows a normal distribution**. If this assumption is violated, the results may still produce an answer, but the interpretation could be misleading or inaccurate.


---
# Why do we care about	**skew** and **kurtosis**?
- Because many statistical analyses assume a normal distribution of the data, testing for normality must always be a precursor to any analysis. 

.pull-left[
- Normally distributed data is:  
  1. Unimodal (one mode)  
  2. Symmetrical (no SKEW)  
  3. Bell Shaped (no KURTOSIS)  
  4. Mean, Mode and Median are all centered  
  5. Asymptotic (tails never reach 0)

---
# What to do about non-normal data?
- Once you discover that your data is non-normal you have several options:
  - Analyze and potentially remove outliers
  - Transform the data mathematically
  - Conduct non-parametric analyses

---
# Outliers?
- How to find outliers:
	- Outlier box plots (visual) use the IQR * 1.5 threshold.
    - **IQR**: `\(Q_3 - Q_1\)`
    - **Lower Threshold**: `\(Q_1 - (1.5 * \text{IQR})\)`
    - **Upper Threshold**: `\(Q_3 + (1.5 * \text{IQR})\)`

- These can help identify potential outliers but **do not justify their removal**.

- Sometimes outliers are **real, correct  (although extreme) observations** that we are truly interested in.

- We can only remove outliers if we know the data is **incorrect**

---
# Working with non-normal Data.
- Transformations:
  - To transform your data, apply a mathematical function to each observation, then use these numbers in your statistical test.
  - There are an infinite number of transformations you could use, but it is better to use one common to our field.

---
# Working with non-normal Data.
- Non-normal data happens. Especially with counts, percents, rare events.

.pull-left[
- Common transformations in our field:  
  - square-root: for moderate skew.  
  - log:  for positively skewed data.  
  - Inverse: for severe skew.  
] 

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="fig/transformation.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
# Square root Transformation
- **Square-root transformation**: This consists of taking the square root of each observation. 

- In R use: `sqrt(X)`.

``` r
data &lt;- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100)
# Apply square-root transformation
sqrt_data &lt;- sqrt(data)
# Goodness of fit test
shapiro.test(sqrt_data)
```

```
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  sqrt_data
*## W = 0.97016, p-value = 0.8924
```

---
# Square root Transformation
- If you apply a square root to a continuous variable that contains **values negative values, decimals and values above 1**, you are treating some numbers differently than others.

- So a constant must be added to move the minimum value of the distribution to 1. 

---
# Log Transformation
- Many variables in biology have log-normal distributions.

- In R use: `log(X)` or `log10(X)`.

``` r
# Sample data (e.g., positive values)
data &lt;- c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000)
# Apply log transformation (log base 10)
log_data &lt;- log10(data)
# Goodness of fit test
shapiro.test(log_data)
```

```
## 
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  log_data
*## W = 0.98189, p-value = 0.9606
```

---
# Log Transformation
- The logarithm of any **negative number is undefined and log functions treat decimals differently than numbers &gt;1**.

- So a constant must be added to move the minimum value of the distribution to 1.

---
# Inverse transformation
- **Inverse transformation**: This consists of taking the inverse \( X^{-1} \) of a number.
- In R use: `1/x` or `x^-1`

``` r
# Sample data (e.g., positive values)
data &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)
# Apply inverse transformation (reciprocal)
inverse_data &lt;- 1 / data
```

- Tends to make big numbers small and small numbers big a constant must be added to move the minimum value of the distribution to 1

---
# Reflecting Transformations
- Each of these transformations can be adjusted for negative skew by taking the reflection.

- To reflect a value, **multiply  data by -1**, and then add a constant to bring the minimum value back above 1.0.

- For example:
  - sqrt(x) for positively skewed data,
  - sqrt((x*-1) + c) for negatively skewed data

  - log10(x) for positively skewed data,
  - log10(x*-1 + c) for negatively skewed data

---
# Rank Transform
- Rank transformation requires sorting your data and then creating a new column where each observation is assigned a rank.
  - For tied values, assign the average rank.
  - Perform all subsequent analyses on the ranked data instead of the original values.

---
# Transformation Rules to Live By
- Transformations work by altering the relative distances between data points. 
- If done correctly, all data points remain in the same relative order as prior to transformation. 
- However, this might be undesirable if the original variables were meant to be substantively interpretable.

---
# Transformation Rules to Live By
- Don't mess with your data unless you have to.
- Are there true outliers? Remove and retest.
- If you have to mess with it, make sure you know what you are doing. Try different transformations to see which is best.
- Include these details in your methods.
- Back transform to original units for reports of central tendency and variability.
- Sometimes transformations don't work, don't panic, you will just get to run **nonparametric tests**.
